# Datenguide viz

Datenguide viz displays various **statistics about German districts of the state of Hesse**. You can compare different years and regions of the state on a map.

Datenguide viz is a voila app showing a Jupyter notebook that employs the **[datenguidepy](https://github.com/CorrelAid/datenguide-python)** package.

You can **start Datenguide viz** as standalone application via binder here:

If the binder is not in the cache, it will be built for you.

## CorrelAidX Challenge 2020

This app was developed by the Team Local Chapter Rhein-Main in the CorrelAidX Challenge 2020 (August to September 2020).

## Extending the app

The Datenguide viz app currently visualizes the districts of Hesse state and includes a small number of potentially interesting statistics from datenguidepy. Feel free to clone the repo and add other statistics (explore them using notebooks/check_stats.ipynb) or extend the app to other federal states like neighboring Thuringia!
